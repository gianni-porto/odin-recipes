# Odin Recipes exercise

## Versiom 1.0 (html only)

a little exercise to learn some html tags:

-   head tag insertion (h1, h2)

-   inserting image tags (img)

-   inserting link tags (a)

-   horizontal line (hr) tag insertion

the version 1.0 has no style and therefore ugly to look at but educational for
beginners

## Versiom 2.0 (added some basic style)

a bit of style to the exercise to make it a little bit pleasing to the eye
